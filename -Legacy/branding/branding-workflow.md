### Evaluate your Brand

On a scale of 1 - 10 determine where your brand should lie on each of these points.

Your teams interpretation of each point will vary widely

2. Group the names by whether they are descriptive, suggestive, abstract, acronyms or real words
3. What trends can you find in the above names
4. How do competitors position themselves with their names
5. Which names stand out from the group
6. What words are common between each name
