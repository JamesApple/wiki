Same reason Tinder ( Match Group who owns all the apps) sent user location data
all over the place.  Normal people will never learn about this , and doing it
right would take too much effort. While I would love new better social media to
take over, I don't think social media which serves it's users is possible.

SOLID
Single-responsibility
  "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."[5] In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.[6]
Openâ€“closed principle 
  "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."[7]
Liskov substitution principle
  "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."[8] See also design by contract.[8]
Interface segregation principle: 
  "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."[9][4]
Dependency inversion principle: 
  "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."[10][4]
