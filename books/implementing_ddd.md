# Implemnenting Domain Driven Design by Vaughn Vernon

## Before I Begin (Meta)

### 1. Why are you reading this

Plenty of people have recommended the red DDD book as a more hands on version
of the blue DDD book.

After having seen the technical complexity that comes from building
applications without engineers having an understanding of the business domain
at small and large companies I want to see some practical use cases where
companies have moved towards DDD and how they worked with stakeholders, other
engineers and senior management to accomplish their objectives.

It is a strong belief of mine that code is communication much like creative
writing and we all need to learn to tell better and more concise stories with
our software.

### 2. What do you hope to gain

Having read the blue DDD book previously I understand the concepts but my
implementations are guided by guesswork and I'd like to see how other
professionals have approached the problems I have encountered.

### 3. What is DDD to you

DDD is a set of patterns and practices that help translate a domain like
psychology, construction or project management into software that reflects its
purpose in its source code as well as in the way teams communicate.
