# Implemnenting Domain Driven Design by Vaughn Vernon

## Before I Begin (Meta)

### 1. Why are you reading this

Plenty of people have recommended the red DDD book as a more hands on version
of the blue DDD book.

After having seen the technical complexity that comes from building
applications without engineers having an understanding of the business domain
at small and large companies I want to see some practical use cases where
companies have moved towards DDD and how they worked with stakeholders, other
engineers and senior management to accomplish their objectives.

It is a strong belief of mine that code is communication much like creative
writing and we all need to learn to tell better and more concise stories with
our software.

### 2. What do you hope to gain

Having read the blue DDD book previously I understand the concepts but my
implementations are guided by guesswork and I'd like to see how other
professionals have approached the problems I have encountered.

### 3. What is DDD to you

DDD is a set of patterns and practices that help translate a domain like
psychology, construction or project management into software that reflects its
purpose in its source code as well as in the way teams communicate.

### 4. What do you not want to get out of this book

I do not want to adopt an overly verbose and heavy version of DDD
implementations that insist on creating incredibly complex class structures for
small applications that seem to come from anyone working in Java. Many of the
examples I have read have referenced patterns that smell way too much like Java
specific advice.

I firmly believe DDD strategic design is beneficial in vanilla JS
microservices, .NET monoliths and Rails apps even if no reference to "entity"
or "aggregate" is found in the code. A consistency boundary can be enforced
without a Java Bean.

# Quotes

> It seems to me that Scrum and other agile techniques are being used as
> substitutes for careful modeling, where a product backlog is thrust at
> developers as if it serves as a set of designs.
> Most agile practicioners leave their daily standup without giving a second
> thought to how their backlog tasks will affect the underlying model of the
> business. Although I assume this is needles to say, I must assert that Scrum,
> for example, was never meant to stand in place of design.
