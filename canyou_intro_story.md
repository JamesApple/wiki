# Prestory

Frank, Joseph and James all interned together after completing their software
bootcamp several years earlier. Joseph and James worked at a mental healthcare
startup and Frank worked elsewhere.

As we interned together at Luxury Escapes we referred to ourselves as "The Lux
Boys".

# Beginning

After all of us having not worked together in quite some time Frank messaged
James to ask for help/advice about his project.

James knew Joseph had just finished his last job and was looking for new
opportunities and recommended Frank try and reforge the team.

All 3 of us met several times over the course of a couple months while we
designed and built the initial product on weekends and evenings after work.

After taking 2 weeks off work to focus James brought up he needed to focus full
time on the product to do it justice and that we should progress as an actual
company instead of ad-hoc as we had done before.
