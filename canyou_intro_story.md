# Prestory

Frank, Joseph and James all interned together after completing their software
bootcamp several years earlier. Joseph and James worked at a mental healthcare
startup and Frank went to another company.

As we interned together at Luxury Escapes we referred to ourselves as "The Lux
Boys".

# Beginning

After all of us having not worked together in quite some time Frank messaged
James to ask for help/advice about his project.

James knew Joseph had just finished his last job and was looking for new
opportunities and recommended Frank try and reforge the team.
